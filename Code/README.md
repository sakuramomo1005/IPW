The folder contains the R codes used for our simulation

* CRA_IPW_codes.R: Codes for analyzing the simulated dataset by using unadjusted CRA, CRA, IPW without cluster effects and IPW with cluster effects

* MMI_codes.R: Codes for analyzing the simulated dataser by using MMI

* MakeTable: Make summary tables that combine the previous results 

* WeightCounts: Counts the features of weigths. i.e. how many weights exceed 20, 100, 500, and 1000
