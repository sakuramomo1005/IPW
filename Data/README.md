This folder contains the saved results from the simulation codes, which are all Rdata files.

The results from CRAs and IPWs are :

* The name is give by: "wrapk" + k value + icc value + iccm values. For example, wrapk500.50.1 means that k=50, icc=0.5, iccm=0.1.

The results from MMI are: 

* The name is give by: "wrapk_mmi" + k value + icc value + iccm values. For example, wrapk500.50.1 means that k=50, icc=0.5, iccm=0.1.

All the results can be downloaded and load into R environment.
